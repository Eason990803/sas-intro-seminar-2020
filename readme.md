# SAS Seminar - September 2020

## Matching of commonly used datasets

The main datasets use different firm identifiers:

- gvkey (Compustat)
- permno (Crsp)
- Central Index Key (CIK) (Audit Analytics, SEC filings)
- IBES Ticker (IBES)

Additionally, also the ticker symbol and Cusip/sedol are commonly used, as well as the firm name itself.

## Topics

In this seminar we will look into matching these datasets:

### Header vs historical values - Compustat - [1_compustat.sas](1_compustat.sas)

### Matching Compustat with Audit Analytics -  [2_audit_analytics.sas](2_audit_analytics.sas)

### Matching Compustat - CRSP - IBES - []()

## SAS Studio

We will be using SAS Studio hosted by WRDS. This way, you don't need a local copy of SAS installed. Also, it is convenient to visually inspect the different datasets on WRDS. (The interface allows you to browse the datasets and click/view these.)
